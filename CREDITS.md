Much of this work is inspired by or remixed from other works by many wonderful people.

[Legrand, Bernard. "Mastering Dyalog APL." Dyalog Limited, November (2009).](https://www.dyalog.com/mastering-dyalog-apl.htm)

This book is *the* guide to Dyalog APL. It does not assume any prior programming knowledge, just high school maths. The book was released when Dyalog was at version 12, so some of the content is not so up to date. Here we aim to fill some gaps as Dyalog has developed since 2009.
- New language features
  - 
- Graphical User Interfaces
The section on Graphical User Interfaces focuses on `⎕WC`, a function which produces GUI objects for Microsoft Windows. We will be creating a guide on creating graphical applications with Dyalog for the APL course. You can find out more about `⎕WC` GUI objects on the [online help](http://help.dyalog.com/17.0/Content/GUI/SummaryTables/GUIOverview.htm).

This book's structured take on teaching programming from scratch has been a great inspiration. Specifically, the [catalogue for programming novices](Catalogues/Noobs.ipynb) has been heavily inspired by this book and some of the explanations have been shameless ripped out from the book. Thankfully, this has been allowed by the author since they published the book under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC 3.0) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/).
