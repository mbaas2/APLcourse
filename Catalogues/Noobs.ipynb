    "### Author's recommendation\n",
    "So on Windows, the Ctrl key gets taken over by the Dyalog input and all the common keyboard shortcuts go to heck. I am learning Japanese, so I have a Japanese [IME](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dxtecharts/installing-and-using-input-method-editors) and use `Win key`+`Space bar` to switch between UK English and Japanese IME keyboard layouts on Windows 10. Because of this, using `Win key`+`Space bar` to switch between UK English (where `Ctrl`+`S` is a 'save file' shortcut) and Dyalog APL (where `Ctrl`+`S` produces `⌈` upstile) wasn't too annoying.\n",

    "On GitHub you can find [abrudz's keyboard layout](https://github.com/abrudz/kbd) which uses the `Alt Gr` key for `APL-shift`. Using [KeyTweak](https://keytweak.en.softonic.com/), I also mapped `Caps Lock` to `Alt Gr` - because WHO NEEDS TO TYPE LIKE THIS ANYWAY‽ So now I use `Caps Lock` or `Alt Gr` to type APL symbols. I can also type `ácçênted Ⓒhàracters` with ease.\n",
