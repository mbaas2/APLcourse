Then we will move on to [system functions]() and [system variables]() (as quickly as possible, these are the ugly quirks of Dyalog, in my opinion). Finally we will set you off on some challenges where you can explore the language and get a feel how APL abstracts away the pain of programming and lets you focus on *how to solve the problem at hand*."
