    "To begin with, we will look at some basics of *array programming*. Secondly, we will play with APL and try to get more comfortable with the syntax. Then we will look at how to manage an APL project. Finally, we will set you off on some challenges with which you can explore the language and get a feel for how APL abstracts away the pain of programming and lets you focus on *how to solve the problem at hand*."
