APLcourse content is entirely in .ipynb [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) files, apart from the READMEs which are in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

The [Table of contents](README.md#Contents) found in the APLcourse [README](README.md) is automatically generated using APL functions in the [\]LINK](https://github.com/dyalog/link)-able `utils` folder.
It only includes files and folders which begin with a captial letter.
