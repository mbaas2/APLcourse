# APLCourse
A New APL Course

### [Table of Contents](TOC.md)

These materials are designed to teach you how to solve real problems using computers. There are exam-like [problem sets](ProblemSets/README.md) and programming [project ideas](Projects/README.md) to test your APL knowledge and problem-solving ability. 

There is also a collection of [tutorials](Tutorials) on various specific APL and programming concepts. There may be linked references to external resources, such as the [APL Wiki](https://aplwiki.miraheze.org) or the book [Mastering Dyalog APL](https://www.dyalog.com/mastering-dyalog-apl.htm).

## Uh... where do I start?
We have some curated catalogues of content for different purposes.
