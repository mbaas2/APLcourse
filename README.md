# APLCourse
A New APL Course

These materials are designed to teach you how to solve real problems using computers. There are exam-like [problem sets](ProblemSets/README.md) and programming [project ideas](Projects/README.md) to test your APL knowledge and problem-solving ability. 

There is also a collection of [tutorials](Tutorials) on various specific APL and programming concepts. There may be linked references to external resources, such as the [APL Wiki](https://aplwiki.miraheze.org) or the book [Mastering Dyalog APL](https://www.dyalog.com/mastering-dyalog-apl.htm).

## How do I use this?
All of the course materials are in `.ipynb` [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). These are interactive documents with code blocks which can be executed if you view them in a Jupyter environment. 

Press the `▶ ` button to execute a cell and move on.  
Press `Shift`+`Enter` to execute a cell and move on.  
Press `Ctrl`+`Enter` to execute a cell and remain in place.

These will be fine for many of the tutorials and short problems. However, if you want to save your work and continue later - as you might when tackling one of the [project ideas](Projects/README.md) - then you should either [install Jupyter locally](Tutorials/InstallingDyalogJupyter.ipynb) or [install Dyalog](https://www.dyalog.com/download-zone.htm). In fact, you will need to install Dyalog in order to use Dyalog Jupyter notebooks locally on your machine.

### **QuickStart**
You can view nicely rendered, static (non-interactive), notebooks using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rikedyp/APLcourse/tree/master/). To view interactive notebooks you can use our [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rikedyp/APLcourse/master).  

In any case, check out the notebook [README](README.ipynb) to get started.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rikedyp/APLcourse/master)

**Note:** The binder may take a minute to load. If you just want to quickly view something then use the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rikedyp/APLcourse/tree/master/).

**Note:** Any changes made to notebooks using the binder will not be saved unless you download the notebook.

**Note:** You can use the [Jupyter lab]() interface with the binder by replacing `tree` with `lab` in the URL.
