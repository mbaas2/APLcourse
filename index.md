# APLCourse
A New APL Course

These materials are designed to teach you how to solve real problems using computers. There are exam-like [problem sets](ProblemSets/README.md) and programming [projects](Projects/README.md) to test your APL knowledge and problem-solving ability. The [wiki](Wiki/README.md) is a collection of tutorials on various specific APL and programming concepts.
