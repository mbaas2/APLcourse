# APLCourse
A New APL Course

These materials are designed to teach you how to solve real problems using computers. There are exam-like [problem sets](#!ProblemSets/README.md) and programming [projects](#!Projects/README.md) to test your APL knowledge and problem-solving ability. 

There is also a collection of [tutorials](#!Tutorials/README.md) on various specific APL and programming concepts. There may be linked references to external resources, such as the [APL Wiki](https://aplwiki.miraheze.org) or the book [Mastering Dyalog APL](https://www.dyalog.com/mastering-dyalog-apl.htm).
